# Kingdom of Aldoria

Aldoria is one of the oldest human kingdoms in the Northern Realms, established after the Great Divide in 892 CR. Known for its rich farmlands, skilled craftsmen, and formidable knights, Aldoria has been a stronghold of human civilization for over five centuries.

## Geography

Aldoria spans the fertile plains between the Azure Mountains to the north and the Great Sea to the south. The kingdom is crossed by several major rivers, including the mighty Silverspear River which serves as both a trade route and natural defense.

## Government

The kingdom is ruled by King Thalion IV of House Valorian, who ascended to the throne in 1392 CR after the passing of his father. The royal court consists of noble houses who control different regions of the kingdom under the king's authority.

## Military

The Knights of the Silver Crown are Aldoria's elite military force, renowned throughout the continent for their skill and honor. They are supported by trained infantry regiments and a small but effective navy that patrols the kingdom's coastal regions.

## Culture

Aldorians value tradition, craftsmanship, and loyalty above all else. Annual festivals celebrate the harvest, the founding of the kingdom, and victories in historic battles. The Royal Academy of Aldoria is one of the most prestigious centers of learning in the known world.

## Trade

Aldoria produces abundant grain, textiles, and fine crafted goods that are traded throughout neighboring kingdoms. The capital city of Highcrown serves as a major trade hub, with merchant guilds wielding significant influence in matters of commerce.
